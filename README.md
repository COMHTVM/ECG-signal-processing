# ECG-signal-processing
Denoising, spectral analysis and filtering the signal. 

Processing of ECG signals involves pre-processing, and then feature extraction. The magnitude and phase plot of the signal is plotted, and then spectral analysis is performed on it using different windowing techniques. Next, different noise are added to the ECG and filtering is done on them. Butterworth filter is used to filter baseline wander and powerline noise. Random noise is added, and filtering is done using synchronized averaging technique. Wiener filtering is also used to remove gaussian noise. Then performance of wavelet energy based diagnostic distortion (WEDD) and clinical component distortion (CCD) measure is analysed. I then used Liner Prediction (LP) model for finding the R-R interval, heart rate and R wave amplitude features.
